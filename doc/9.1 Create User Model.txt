Create User Model:
-- Define our User resource:
	+ Decide what data we want to store with each user object. Your requirements
		will change over time, so try starting with a basic set of attributes
		and update the resource as needed.
	+ Basic set of attributes to store:
		- id : unique identifier, represented as a positive integer
		- name : user's full fame
		- email : user's email address
		- created_at : date user account was created
		- updated_at: date user account was last updated
		- deleted_at : date user account was deleted (using this to "delete"
			accounts without actually removing them. This is useful for when
			a user might be hacked and have the account deleted and we can then
			bring it back. You can permanently delete a user after a set time.
			GORM is designed to ignore models with a deleted_at attribute by
			default.)
	+ Create folder for models like we did for controllers and create file for
		the User model
	+ In the User model file, create the type struct to have the attributes we
		want to store for the users
			package models

			import (
				"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
			)

			type User struct {
				gorm.Model 
				Name       string
				Email      string `gorm:"not null;unique_index"` 
			}
