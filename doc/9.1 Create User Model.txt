Create User Model:
-- Define our User resource:
	+ Decide what data we want to store with each user object. Your requirements
		will change over time, so try starting with a basic set of attributes
		and update the resource as needed.
	+ Basic set of attributes to store:
		- id : unique identifier, represented as a positive integer
		- name : user's full fame
		- email : user's email address
		- created_at : date user account was created
		- updated_at: date user account was last updated
		- deleted_at : date user account was deleted (using this to "delete"
			accounts without actually removing them. This is useful for when
			a user might be hacked and have the account deleted and we can then
			bring it back. You can permanently delete a user after a set time.
			GORM is designed to ignore models with a deleted_at attribute by
			default.)
	+ Create folder for models like we did for controllers and create file for
		the User model
	+ In the User model file, create the type struct to have the attributes we
		want to store for the users
			package models

			import (
				"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
			)

			type User struct {
				gorm.Model 
				Name       string
				Email      string `gorm:"not null;unique_index"` 
			}
-- Create Interface for Database:
	+ Make an abstraction layer (UserService) for connecting the model to the 
		database.
		- Don't want to interact with GORM directly in most of the app because
			we may want to stop using GORM or even change our database to another
			kind.
		- Gives us one area to update database implementation details without
			needing to update any controller or view code as well
		- This type will provide methods for querying, creating, and updating
			users.
		- This type needs access to a gorm.DB pointer so we can interact with a
			GORM object as needed versus acting directly on the object all
			throughtout the code.

		type UserService struct {
			db *gorm.DB 
		}

	+ Open connection to database with GORM :
		- This function opens a connection to a database (connectionInfo) and 
			returns a gorm.DB object to our UserService to use. It also logs the
			SQL run. Do not close the database in this function as it would 
			close before it returns the object to the UserService.

		func NewUserService(connectionInfo string) (*UserService, error) {
			// End user passes a string defining how to connect to the database and we
			// want to use the postgres dialect.
			db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", connectionInfo)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}

			db.LogMode(true)
			return &UserService{
				db: db,
			}, nil
		}
	+ Close connection to database :
		- This method closes the UserService database connection

		func (us *UserService) Close() error {
			return us.db.Close()
		}
	+ Add method to query database :
		- This method allows us to retrieve a user from the database based on
			the ID of user
		- Create custom error message in the case of UserService not finding
			any matching record in the database so we can differentiate it from
			some other issue happening behind the scenes (such as not connecting
			to the database)
		- ByID will look up a user with the provided ID. If the user is found, we
			return nil error and information to User model. If user is not found
			we return the custom error variable. If there is a different error,
			we return whatever error was generated.

		var (
			ErrNotFound = errors.New("models: resource not found in database")
		)

		func (us *UserService) ByID(id uint) (*User, error) {
			var user User
			err := us.db.Where("id = ?", id).First(&user).Error
			switch err {
			case nil:
				return &user, nil
			case gorm.ErrRecordNotFound:
				return nil, ErrNotFound
			default:
				return nil, err
			}
		}

	+ Add method to destroy/recreate tables in the database:
		- This method allows us to destroy existing tables and recreate them. It
			is useful in a development environment when we want to quickly reset
			our database.
		- Calls the DropTableIfExists method on the users table
		- Rebuild the users table using AutoMigrate function

		func (us *UserService) DestructiveReset() {
			us.db.DropTableIfExists(&User{})
			us.db.AutoMigrate(&User{})
		}

-- Create Users :
	func (us *UserService) Create(user *User) error {
		return us.db.Create(user).Error
	}

	+ This method will create the provided user and backfill data.
	+ Input a pointer to the User model object, run the gorm.DB Create method
		on it to save the User data to the database, and then return an error
		or nil if it runs successfully.
	+ It doesn't need to return a user object because it accepts a pointer to one
		and instead just updated the provided user.
-- DRY your Code :
	+ Don't add more methods than a service immediately needs, unless you know
		will definitely be needed in the future (such as using a unique field
		like email to query users by for finding their log in)
	+ Look for ways to DRY your code/methods, such as if you are going to have
		multiple queries that will return the same things based on situations.
		-- Example: We are searching for user by ID, email, or any individual
			field and will only want to retrieve the first returned, return
			custom error if user isn't found, or return any other errors.
	+ Create function to run common First() type query:
		func first(db *gorm.DB, dst interface{}) error {
			err := db.First(dst).Error
			if err == gorm.ErrRecordNotFound {
				return ErrNotFound
			}
			return err
		}
	+ Update methods to use new helper query function:
		func (us *UserService) ByID(id uint) (*User, error) {
			var user User
			db := us.db.Where("id = ?", id)
			err := first(db, &user)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			return &user, nil
		}
	+ Create Email query method with new helper function:
		func (us *UserService) ByEmail(email string) (*User, error) {
			var user User
			db := us.db.Where("email = ?", email)
			err := first(db, &user)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			return &user, nil
		}
-- Update/Delete users :
	+ Create method to update users: This method will update the provided user with all the data in the provided User model object.
		func (us *UserService) Update(user *User) error {
			return us.db.Save(user).Error
		}
	+ Delete users via GORM:
		-- GORM's Delete method works two ways- provide user object that has an
			ID and GORM will delete user with that primary id key ; or if we
			DO NOT provide an ID, then ALL users are deleted
		-- Create code for when NO ID happens to prevent deleting all users

		var (
			ErrInvalidID = errors.New("models: ID provided was invalid")
		)
	+ Error handling : Errors are very different in Go. They are not your 
		traditional exceptions, but instead are values that can be returned, 
		used to dictate logic, and aren’t incredibly expensive. As a result, it
		isn’t uncommon or frowned upon to use them to determine the flow of your
		program.
