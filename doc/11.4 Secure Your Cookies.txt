Secure Your Cookies:

-- 5 Major Attack vectors regarding cookies:
	+ Cookie tampering
	+ Database leak allowing users to create fake cookies
	+ Cross site scripting (XSS)
	+ Cookie theft via packet sniffing
	+ Cookie theft via physical access to device cookie is stored on

-- Cookie Tampering:
	+ Since cookies are stored on the user's computer they can tamper with the
		cookie.
	+ Digitally sign the data you store in the cookie to help prevent tampering.
		-- This can be done by creating signature to attach to the cookie using
			a hashing function (such as HMAC, JSON Web Tokens).
		-- Validate a user's cookie by hashing the data returned and compare it
			to the hash stored in the cookie to see if they match
	+ Obfuscating cookie data is another way to help prevent tamperings.
		-- Rather than storing data that is easy to fake (ex: email, ID), we will
			store a "remember token" that looks like gibberish and has no clear
			mapping to users
		-- Achieve this by generating a random string everytime a user logs in,
			assigning that string to the user's remember token field, then when
			the user logs in again we find the user via that field
