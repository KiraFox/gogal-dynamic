Bootstrap Intro:
-- When you submit a form to a server, it recieves data in format similar to a map
	+  Name of each input field is used as a key in the map
	+  Information user typed into the field is used as the value
	+  Ex: setting the "name" attribute to "email" means we want the key for the
		input field to be "email" when submitted to our server
-- Panels in Bootstrap : wrap contents in a container to make it more obvious
	that everything in the container is related
	+  Will be using panel to make clear which fields are used in sign up form
-- Grid system in Bootstrap : allows to define rows and columns, which give a 
	way to layout page
	+  Use to define how large we want signup form to be depending on the user's
		screen size
	+  First create a row then place columns ; there are 12 in the grid system
		-- Going to set signup form to take up 4 columns on md or larger screens
		-- Offset left by 4 columns so signup form is center
		-- <div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
-- Colors in Bootstrap : comes with a few base contextual colors that can be used
	on nearly any bootstrap element
	+  Color is named by context
	CSS Class / name 	Default Color
	Default 			white/gray
	primary 			blue
	success 			green
	info 				light blue
	warning 			yellow
	danger 				red
	+  Ex: <div class="panel panel-primary"> ((primary is the color))
		<div class="panel-heading">
-- Media sizes : general rule that anyone on screen size md (medium) or larger is
	viewing your site on computer or tablet
-- Adding right navbar content: 
	<ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
	<li><a href="/signup">Sign Up</a></li>
	</ul>
