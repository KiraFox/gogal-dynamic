Create and View Cookies:

--Create Cookie using Go:
	+ Use the net/http package using two steps:
		-- Instantiate a Cookie, which is a type provided by the net/http package
		-- Call the SetCookie function provided by the net/http package, passing
			in both a ResponseWriter and the Cookie we just created
	+ Beware of Invalid Cookies:
		-- If you have trouble with cookies not saving, be sure to double check 
			that the cookie is valid.
		-- SetCookie function states that "Invalid cookies may be dropped"
		-- May not see an error when an invalid cookie is saved, and code may
			continue as if there was nothing wrong.
	+ Cookies have details we can configure, such as securing them (which comes
		later).
		-- Basic details are a key and a value associated to that key
	+ Update Login method in User's controller file:
		-- Put the error handling logic in an if statement and tell the function
			to return at the end of the if statement to return any errors to us
			instead of continuing with an unverified user
		-- Next create a Cookie (using the net/http package) using the key (Name)
			"email"	and the value will be the email address of the user returned
			by the Authenticate method before it. Be sure to put it after the
			error handling.
		-- Use the SetCookie function to save/persist the cookie.
-- View Cookie using Go:
	+ Call the Cookie method implemented by the http.Request objecy to access
		cookies we set in past web requests
	+ Create action on User's controller that uses the Cookie method and retrieve
		the cookie we created in the Login handler
	+ Once the cookie is retrieved, print it out to the screen so we can see any
		of the information set on the cookie

		func (u *Users) CookieTest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			cookie, err := r.Cookie("email")
			if err != nil {
				http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			}
			fmt.Fprintln(w, "Email is:", cookie.Value)
		}

	+ Add the new handler (CookieTest) to the router. 
		r.HandleFunc("/cookietest", usersC.CookieTest).Methods("GET")
	+ USE IN DEV ONLY: Use this for testing purposes to check that your cookies
		are doing what you want.
