7.2 REST Intro:
-- Architectural style for developing software and networked systems
-- Model most pieces of web app around resources (ex: user, gallery, image)
	+  Things that can be created/read/updated/deleted (CRUD)
	+  Use as a guideline as you create models/controllers/views
	+  Shouldnâ€™t get caught up in trying to find the perfect resource 
	representation of everything in your application especially if harder to
	understand or maintain
-- HTTP request methods:
	HTTP Method 		What it signifies
	GET 				Reading a resource
	POST 				Creating a resource
	PUT 				Updating a resource
	PATCH 				Updating a resource
	DELETE 				Deleting a resource
	+  Help dictate intent when you make a web request
	+  Used in conjunction with paths in our web app and paths help determine 
		what controlers we should be creating
	+  PUT accepts an entirely new representation of an object even if some
	fields remained the same
	+  PATCH only accepts provides only updated fields to a resource
	+  Ex: Galleries resource will have a controller, model, and views that will
	be organized in the galleries folder
