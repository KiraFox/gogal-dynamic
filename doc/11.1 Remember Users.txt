Remember Users:
-- Stateless Server: when a user visits the web app, it has no knowledge
	of who that user is. Server sees a single web request and expects all details
	of the request are contained within it. 
	+ Highly scalable web app because it doesn't matter which server the request
		goes to.
	+ Have user tell you who they are in every request, instead of "remembering"
		or storing any actual state
	+ Make sure to use ways to verify the user is telling the truth
-- Cookies:
	+ Basic definition is data that is stored on a user's computer
	+ Visiting website that creates a cookie stores the file on your computer
	+ Browser will automatically include cookies the website has permission to
		access
	+ Use cookies to remember users, secure the cookies, and limit user access
		to pages using data in the cookies
