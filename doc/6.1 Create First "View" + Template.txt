Create First "View" + Template:

-- Create folder called "views" under main project folder
-- Create first template for the home page in "views" folder:
	+ Create new document called "home.gohtml" 
	+ Input HTML code for the home page
-- Render template instead of writing string directly with Fprint
	+ Create global variable to store the parsed template then use the template 
	inside our "home" function
	+ This will be cleaned up later.  Try not to use global variables as they
	can cause issues and be hard to test.
	+ Make sure this variable gets assigned to a parsed template 
-- Update home function so that it uses the new template
	+ Use Execute method to write results to the ResponseWriter instead of 
	Stdout so it will be returned to the user making the web request.
	+ Added error handling incase the Execute runs into issues such as it might
	try to access a variable we didn't provide
	+ Passing nil to Execute because the template doesn't currently use any 
	dynamic data so we are passing "no data" == nil
-- Stop and restart application to see changes on webpage:
	+ Application only parses the template once when it starts up
	+ Can be tedious during development but speeds up production because it 
	doesn't need to reread template files every time a user visits a page
