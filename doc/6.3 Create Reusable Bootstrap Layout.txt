Create Reusable Bootstrap Layout :
-- Create Views that allow reusing templates (such as nav bar and footer)
-- Named templates
	+  Go's template library allows you to define a name for your template so
	you can use it elsewhere
	+  Name must be unique!
	+  Start named template code with {{define "name-here"}} and close it with
	{{end}}
	+  To use in another template, input the code {{template "name-here"}} where
	you want the named template contents to run/show
-- Create new folder "Layouts" inside the "Views" folder to store shared layout
templates
	+  Create new file "footer.gohtml" for a shared footer 
	{{define "footer"}}
	<footer>
		<p>

		</p>
	</footer>
	{{end}}
-- Change main.go and views files to use new layout:
	+  Need to ParseFiles on the layout file (on all current templates):  
		
		homeTemplate, err = template.ParseFiles("views/home.gohtml",
		"views/layouts/footer.gohtml")
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	+  We now have access to the named “footer” template inside of our home and 
	contact templates. Need to update our html code so that it knows to also 
	render the footer template:

		contact.gohtml :

		{{template "footer"}}

-- Passing data to named templates :
	+ need to provide additional argument in your code
	+ {{template "footer" .}} : the period means pass all of the data we have 
	to the footer template.
	+ {{template "footer" .Name}} : is passing a specific piece of data (Name)
